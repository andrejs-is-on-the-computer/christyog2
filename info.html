            My vision
          </h3>
          
          Yoga is an art of daily living. I wish to offer the participants in 
          my classes a harmonious life through a benevolent and safe practice of 
          yoga adapted to the needs of each student.
          <hr style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          Yoga allows a holistic approach to our being. The word yoga means "Union". 
          The goal is that each class activates the 5 layers of our being. Our physical 
          body Annamaya Kosha through postures, our energy body Pranamaya Kosha through 
          breathing practices, our mental and emotional body Manomaya Kosha through 
          meditations, our body of knowledge Vijnanamaya Kosha through the discovery 
          of the philosophy of yoga and our body of bliss Anandamaya Kosha through 
          chanting mantras or Yoga nidra.
          <hr style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          Through my classes, I also want to share the philosophical concepts of yoga.
          Each course is organized around a theme. This theme can be of a physical 
          nature (opening of the hips, relaxation of the shoulders, relaxation of the 
          neck, etc.), philosophical (yamas and niyamas, koshas, ​​etc.) or even personal 
          development (improving sleep, daring to shine , conquer your fears, ....). 
          Classes include an introduction to the theme, centration, warm-up, postures 
          (asanas), relaxation with meditation (mantras) and breathing exercises 
          (pranayama).

            Is Yoga for me?
          </h3>
          <hr style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
          Yoga is beneficial for all of us. You should neither have a perfect body, nor be young, flexible or athletic. 
          Mastering your breathing is already doing yoga.
          <br><br>
          There are a large number of different practices, each with its own specificities, objectives and benefits. 
          The trick is to identify the yoga that suits you best. The benefits of yoga are numerous and more and more scientific studies prove it.
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;">
            What type of yoga?
          </h3>
          
          <hr style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
          I mainly teach Hatha Yoga with the fundamental basis of body alignment and the safe and benevolent execution of postures.
          <br><br>
          To enrich my classes or for specific needs I also use other types of yoga, such as Restorative Yoga (a yoga using many 
          accessories for more comfort in the postures), Yin Yoga (prolonged duration of the postures for a deep stretch of the muscles) 
          or Kundalini Yoga (for work on the vital energy of the body).

          I was born in 1961 to German parents. I grew up in Brussels in an international environment. 
          As a young teenager, I dreamed of becoming a sports teacher. In the end my choice turned to 
          architecture. An exciting job that I have exercised in different structures: from my own 
          architecture studio to a company, world leader in its specialty. They were very enriching 
          experiences. Little by little my vision of priority management in the business world was 
          moving away from my values. There followed an intense period of reflection on what I wanted 
          to do with my life.
          <hr style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
          Passionate about yoga since the 2000s, I have followed intense training in order to deepen 
          my personal practice. These trainings totally changed my vision of yoga. With the discovery 
          of philosophy, alignment in postures, conscious practice of breathing, it was a transformation 
          on a physical level but before on a personal level. I learned that exercising yoga on the 
          mat is a reflection of our habits in life and that by adapting its practice on the mat, 
          we can export these benefits into everyday life. Enriched by this experience, I felt 
          invested in sharing what I had learned so that others could also benefit from it. Since 
          then, I have been leading yoga workshops in the beautiful city of Granada in Spain, where 
          I settled with my husband Philippe. Today, I am fortunate to be able to devote myself 
          completely to my two passions: yoga and ceramics.
